Implementing mutation with visitor seems to break encapsulation: you
need to pass an object with setter methods to a visitor.  Well, it can
be said that the visitor pattern already breaks encapsulation (even if
there is no mutation involved) because a visitor takes the internal
state of an object as arguments.

Need to consult a textbook on design patterns.
